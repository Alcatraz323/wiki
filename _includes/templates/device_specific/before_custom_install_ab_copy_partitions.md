## Pre-install instructions

In some cases slot `b` can be unpopulated or contain much older firmware than slot `a`, leading to various issues including a potential hard-brick. We can ensure none of that will happen by copying the contents of slot `a` to slot `b`. This step is NOT optional.

To do this, sideload the copy-partitions-20210323_1922.zip package by doing the following:
1. Download the `copy-partitions-20210323_1922.zip` file from [here](https://github.com/PixelExperience-Devices/blobs/blob/main/copy-partitions-20210323_1922.zip?raw=true).
{% if device.uses_custom_recovery %}
2. Sideload the `copy-partitions-20210323_1922.zip` package:
    * On the device, select "Advanced", "ADB Sideload", then swipe to begin sideload
    * On the host machine, sideload the package using: `adb sideload filename.zip`
{% else %}
2. Sideload the `copy-partitions-20210323_1922.zip` package:
    * On the device, select "Apply Update", then "Apply from ADB" to begin sideload.
    * On the host machine, sideload the package using: `adb sideload copy-partitions-20210323_1922.zip`
{% endif %}
