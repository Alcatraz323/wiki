_PixelExperience, please support my new device!_

It's up to you.

Sorry to let you down, but PixelExperience device support has nothing to do with the number of device requests received. The folks who maintain devices for PixelExperience choose devices that interest them. Remember, these are regular people enjoying a hobby. PixelExperience is not a corporation with employees.

If you know someone who has knowledge in building ROMs, you can send [this url](https://github.com/PixelExperience/official_devices/blob/master/README.md) to that person.
